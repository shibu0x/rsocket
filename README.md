# rsocket

rsocket is a webSocket protocol implementation written in rust.

this is just a learning project for me while I’m exploring rust and networking protocols.

the goal is to understand, at a low level, how data transfers bit-by-bit from one device to another in a webSocket protocol how existing protocols work, where they can be improved, and what enhancements might be needed.

it’s currently in the building phase, and the work is still ongoing. As it grows and more features are added, i’ll keep updating the readme.

keep learning, keep building.
